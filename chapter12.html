 <h2>PRESIDENTIAL INITIATIVE FOR ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE AND COMPUTING</h2>
 <p>Presidential Initiative for Artificial Intelligence and Computing (PIAIC) is a privately funded not
for-profit educational initiative started by President of Pakistan, Dr. Arif Alvi, Kazi Rahat Ali, and
 Zia Khan to help promote education, research and business opportunities in emerging tech
 fields like</p>

 <li>Artificial Intelligence</li>
 <li>Blockchain</li>
 <li>Internet Of Things</li>
</ul>
 <h3><span>C</span>loud Native computing:</h3>
 <p>
 The <b>Cloud Native Computing</b> program prepares the students to program in open source
 technologies like, <b><i>Linux, Docker, Kubernetes, JavaScript, Node.js, React and React Native</i></b>
 while introducing the students to development of Microservices and software development
 techniques on cloud platforms like AWS.
 </p>
 <h3><span>A</span>rtificial Intelligence:</h3>
 <p>
 The artificial intelligence program of PIAIC takes the student through the foundation of the AI
 technology, via teaching programming in open source languages like <b><i>Python, Numpy, Pandas,
 Tensorflow 2.0 and Flask,</i></b> and teaching deploying practical AI solutions and use cases, and
 ending with real-life examples of modern day AI in practice.</p> 
 <h3><span>B</span>lockchain:</h3>
 The main emphasis of <b>Blockchain</b> program is to understand the blockchains like <b><i>Ethereum
 and Hyperledger (Fabric),</i></b> and learn to program in languages such as Solidity, JavaScript on
 frameworks like Node.js. The program also introduces them to development of Distributed Apps
 (DApps), frameworks like Web3 and Truffle and an in-depth understanding of Blockchain-as-a
service (BaaS) and how to develop and offer an Initial Coin Offering (ICO) of a crypto-token.
<h3><span>I</span>nternet of Things:</h3>
<p>
 The <b>Internet of things</b> program introduces the students to open source development
 technologies like <b><i>Rust, Embedded Rust, WebAssembly, Hyper, Diesel, Google Assistant,
 and Kubernetes</i></b> while making them efficient in developing Micro Services for IoT Edge, IoT
 Cloud, and voice computing for device control.
